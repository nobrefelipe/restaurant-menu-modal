# Restaurant Menu Modal

Vue.js lab project for `www.nomade.studio` website.

This simulates a fake restaurant menu item opening effect, going to more details about the food.

It uses Vue.js and also simulated a rest api call in order to get more details once clicked.



## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
